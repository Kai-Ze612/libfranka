## Introduction
This project is part of the IMPL (Intelligent Manipulation and Planning Laboratory) course, specifically for Assignment 3. The main focus is on implementing impedance control for a Franka robot arm. Through this project, we explore the practical application of impedance control in robotic manipulation tasks and gain hands-on experience with the libfranka library.
Features

## Implementation of impedance control for the Franka robot arm
* Utilization of the libfranka library to execute specific robot commands
* Analysis of impedance control performance in two key tasks:
  1. Hand-guiding trajectory recording
  2. Replay of the recorded hand-guided trajectory
  3. Execution of a code-based designed trajectory

## Code Location
All code for Assignment 3 is located in the libfranka/examples directory. This directory contains the necessary examples and implementations for the impedance control tasks.
