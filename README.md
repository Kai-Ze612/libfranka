## Introduction:
This project is part of the IMPL (Intelligent Manipulation and Planning Laboratory) course, specifically for Assignment 3. The main focus is on implementing impedance control for a Franka robot arm. Through this project, we explore the practical application of impedance control in robotic manipulation tasks and gain hands-on experience with the libfranka library.

## Features
* Implementation of impedance control for the Franka robot arm
* Utilization of the libfranka library to execute specific robot commands
* Analysis of impedance control performance in two key tasks:
    * Hand-guiding
    * Replay trajectory
 
## Code Location
All code for Assignment 3 is located in the libfranka/examples directory. This directory contains the necessary examples and implementations for the impedance control tasks.
